# Databases

DynamoDB and Athena are the only databases in AWS that support pay per use pricing, therefor they are the only databases at the moment that can be included in this example.

[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a key value and document database used for OLTP (Online Transactional Processing)

[Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) is a SQL Query service that lets you query data stored in S3 used for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

Between them with some glue (hehe) joining them together you can effectively serve most applications use cases.
